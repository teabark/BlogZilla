     dramatic opening day victory and spare Red Devils blushes after host of missed chances',
     'A low cross from the right and a poke with the left foot from a new signing. In an instant a game was won and an 
     evening transformed. Welcome to Manchester United Joshua Zirkee.For 87 minutes this had been another United 
     performance taken from the vaults of last season. Some light and some shade but nothing that had been consistently 
     impressive or good enough. Manager Erik ten Hag had said his team were not ready for the new season and he was in danger
     of being proved right. A draw here and the mood music of last season would have been back.But if Uniteds newly assembled 
    football department have tried to do one thing this summer it has been to add depth to Ten Hags squad. Zirkee is
       a 23-year-old Dutch forward signed from Bologna and though he started the night among the substitutes here, he emerged 
       to deliver the kind of impact we all dream about as schoolkids.'
